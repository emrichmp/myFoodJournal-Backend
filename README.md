# myFoodJournal!
Frontend Repo: https://github.com/emrichmp/myFoodJournal-Frontend
*** Please check out the front-end repo, I go more in-depth into this project on the front-end and I did not want to just copy and paste the same README on both ends (lol) ***

### Description
myFoodJournal brings all your food tracking needs! myFoodJournal lets a user to add food to their meals in their diary. They also may add their goals and macros so they can hit those goals and track along with it. If a user doesn't know where to start they can also use the included TDEE calculator to find an estimated caloric intake and a recommended macro breakdown! *This is just the back-end so this will handle all the data manipulation but the front end is were the user gets this true experience! So go check out the front end!*

### Short Project Explained
This Ruby on Rails API/Backend was created using 'rails' and 'fast_jsonapi' gems to quickly establish an API. It follows the MVC conventions and uses Serializers to sort the data. This Project also recruits the use of 'rack-cors' for fetch calls from the front-end, 'bcrypt' for ActiveRecord passwords, postgres for the database and 'puma' for the server. The backend handles all the data relationships and creation.
